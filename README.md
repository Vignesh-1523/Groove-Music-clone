Windows 10 - Groove Music Application Clone

Designed and implemented a fully functional replica of the Windows 10 Groove Music application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ambitious project seamlessly mirrors the aesthetics and functionalities of the original Groove Music app, bringing the immersive experience of a native music player to the browser. You can do all play functions as in normal music application

Note : This music website is bit slower because of time taken to load songs and its details into the website. So, I request all to wait for songs to load as it takes from 30 sec to nearly a minute to load and request all to handle it slowly while playing and changing songs also take a bit of loading time. Though the connection is slow, after few seconds it will play properly.

Added one more feature on 20/12/23 - Now you can search the listed songs and play.
